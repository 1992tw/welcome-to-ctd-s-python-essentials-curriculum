This is why we ask all students to give a short demo of their final projects.  This demo is NOT graded and your performance in the demo will have no bearing on your graduation.  Please record a 3-5 minute presentation that touches on all of the following:\n - [ ] demonstrate the data visualizations you created with your Kaggle project\n - [ ] demonstrate and describe the workings of your Local Data Scraping project done with Dash or Streamlit\n\nRubric details for the Kaggle Project and Scraping Project can be seen below.  Be sure both your projects meet the requirements specified for each.\n\n### How to record your presentation\nYou can record your presentation in any of these three ways: \n 1. Logging into your personal Zoom account and record your personal meeting where only you are in attendance and you are screensharing your work ([this is a link to a video on how to do this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=njwbjFYCbGU))\n 2. Use a screen recording program already on your machine\n    * [Mac users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9Byefp51tY)\n    * [Windows users can use this link to watch a how-to video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJB7pM5bvNI)\n 3. Use an online option such as loom ([link to a how to video on loom here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oAdLPbfXcQo)).\n\n### How to upload your video so it can be shared\n<details>\n<summary>Click here to expand detailed instructions on how to upload your recording</summary>\n<br>\n<h4>1.

This week, your goals are:\n1. **Finish and submit your final projects**.\n2. **Record a short project presentation** to share with the rest of the class.\n\nPlease refer to the assignment section below and/or your Week 13 Lesson for Kaggle Project and Week 14 Lesson for your Local Scraping Project to review details and make sure your final projects meet requirements.  Also in the assignment section, you have detailed instructions on how to make and prepare a video of your demonstrated working projects to share with us.   Once you've completed your final projects and video, you'll submit all of these things with your usual Submit Assignment form that you've been using each week.  The form will have additional fields on it to allow you share your Local Scraping Project repo link, your Kaggle link, as well as some information that goes with your video link.  \n\nWhat happens next?\nOnce you've submitted your finals and your video, your reviewer will check your work on your final projects and either declare them needing revisions or being successful, as they have with all your other assignments.  Watch you email for those results.  \n\nTo view your and your classmates' final project presentations, you can visit your class gallery here: [Jamaican Boa Python Essentails Class - Video Demo Gallery](https://airtable.com/appoSRJMlXH9KvE6w/shrqml5HWXby1FzEz/tblTvxLLUlqtgtfbq)\n\nAs always, reach out to a mentor if you need help this week.
